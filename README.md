STEPS INVOLVED:

ADDING ASSET LIBRARY:

Provided folder sample_asset, 

open blender 4.0v ->Edit -> preferences->file path->asset libraries

Add the folder sample_asset and remove user paths.

Now to avail of the asset feature change from 3Dviewport to asset brower.

IMAGE RENDERING

For image rendering , first switch to Viewport Shading to display the rendered preview

Then add the lights in appropriate locations to include shadow, lighting, and texture in your 3d object.

To display a specific position in an image, you would need to add a camera in that position. This can be done by selecting the camera option and placing it where you want it to be displayed. Once the camera is in place, you can adjust its settings to get the desired image output.

Finally, render the image, thus we get a 2d image of our 3d object.
